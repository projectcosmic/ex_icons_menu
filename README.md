INTRODUCTION
------------

Extends the [External-use Icons](https://www.drupal.org/project/ex_icons) into
Drupal menu items, allowing an icon selection for menu links.

Note: this module does not display any of the icons selected. It is up to the
theme to display the icons as required.

Menu links from `extension.links.menu.yml` and similar declarations of links
created in code can add their own icon choice by setting the value of
`ex_icons_menu_icon` in the `metadata` of the menu link plugin definition.
